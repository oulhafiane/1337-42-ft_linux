# My Own Distribution Of Linux
ft_linux is a school project helps you to make your own linux distribution

## Introduction
Welcome to ft_linux.  
In this subject, you have to build a basic, but functional, linux distribution.  
This subject is not about Kernel programming, but it’s highly related.  
This distro will be the base for all your kernel projects, because all your kernel-code will
be executed here, on your distro.  
Try to implement what you want/need to. This is your userspace, take care of it!  

## Goals
• Build a Linux Kernel.  
• Install some binaries (See the list below).  
• Implement a filesystem hierarchy compliant with the standards.  
• Connect to the Internet.
